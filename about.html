      <h1>What is SpeedRead?</h1>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>As you read this you are probably pronouncing the words to yourself. This is called subvocalization and almost everyone does it. Some actually move their lips or say the words under their breath, while others simply say each word in their heads.</p>
      <p>Regardless of how you subvocalize, it slows you down.</p>
      <p>SpeedRead is a tool for improving reading speed by training you out of the habit of subvocalizing. A string of characters will flash on the screen. Your task is to remember what you see and enter it on screen. As your perception improves, the task will become more difficult.</p>
      <p><strong>Take a breath, focus on the screen, and improve.</strong></p>
